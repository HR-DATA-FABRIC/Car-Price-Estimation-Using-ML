# Car-Price-Estimation-Using-ML

A fictional Dutch carmaker aims to enter the US consumer-market. 
Their BI-department researched car features—the independent variables—that are likely to affect the selling price of a car. 
This dataset is needed to model how car prices vary with the independent variables. 
In other words, the company needs to build a DSI-stack that can predict a car’s selling price based on its physical features and components alone.

 This will help the company to adjust their design, business strategy, etc. to meet certain price levels.
